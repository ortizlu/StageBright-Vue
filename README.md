# stagebright-client

## Project setup

This is eventually going to be a refactor of one of my personal projects "StageBright", but built using the Framework Vue. I chose this topic because it was my original plan to implement Vue in this project but the time constraints limited me from learning well enough to use it. I was made aware of Vue through the countless of videos that pin Angular, React, and Vue together.

###What Problem Does it Solve?
Vue solves the problem of client based rendering, while before everything was rendered in the server and an HTML file was sent to the client, now we have enough processing power to simply send data (like JSON) to the client and have it rendered by the client.

###Why does one use it?
Because it is far easier than laying out a project using pure JS, and we are able to recycle code through compoents. It is similar to React.JS

###What is the history of this technology?
Vue was built by Evan You, an ex-Google employee who saw problems with both Angular and React, so he decided to create a new framework that would have the best of both of these technologies. It is currently maintained by a group of developers which includes Evan himself.

###What is your opinion on the technology
I think coming from React, Vue is similar in some ways, but in other ways the learning curve is hard if coming from another framework. It is more organized than react, which I prefer.

###What are the biggest conceptual hurdles, if any?
Style, Script tags and the "template" tag are inside one file, which makes separation of concerns a little hard to understand.

###What resources do you recommend for interested students
The Vue.JS documentation, as well as the Scrimba tutorials found in the docs.

###What are some interview questions one might be asked about this tech?

1. Explain how to do a 2 way binding in Vue.
2. Where are methods stored in a .Vue file
3. What are the different attributes we could attach to a tag?
